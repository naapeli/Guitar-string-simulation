This is a fun little project at the end of my partial differential equations course. First I wanted to solve PDE's numerically using the finite difference method. In the end, the project included a little fourier analysis to get the harmonics for converting the vibrating string into sounds (inspiration from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MavAU3adGk4)). After acquiring the guitar notes, I recreated a part of a song with them. Here is the result!

Let her go - Passenger:

An easier case of solving the wave equation using the finite difference method:

The 3 dimensional plot of the solution to the wave equation:

Making the song sound better would require me to change the values of $\gamma$ and $l$ (in [Code](https://github.com/naapeli/Guitar-string-simulation/blob/main/Guitar%20string.py)), however I'm going to move on to other projects. I'll leave that as an excercise for the viewer :D.
